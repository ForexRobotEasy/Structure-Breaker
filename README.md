## How it Works

The Structure Breaker EA analyzes market prices to detect break of structure patterns. It compares the previous and current high and low prices to determine the occurrence of a shift in price momentum. Based on the detected pattern, the EA can execute buy or sell orders or execute a desired trading strategy.

Here's a breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Check if the account meets the minimum starting capital requirement. If not, an insufficient account balance message is printed.
2. Check if the account leverage meets the recommended requirement. If not, an insufficient account leverage message is printed.
3. Loop through each trading pair.
4. Loop through each timeframe.
5. Analyze market prices to detect break of structure patterns.
6. Determine market sentiment based on the occurrence of a shift in price momentum.
7. Use the break of structure concept to forecast future price movements.
8. Execute buy or sell orders or execute a desired trading strategy based on the detected pattern.
9. Implement VPS hosting functionality for seamless trading operations.
